    <center><span class="caption">The sneaker, which is apparently of the EXT persuasion, has already been dubbed the Nike LeBron<br> 12 "Prism," although the look isn't too close to the previous "Prism" pair of LeBrons. That the<br>sneaker is still on the way means that there is still gas in the tank left for the LeBron 12 proper in a<br>season otherwise populated by LeBron 12 Lows and LeBron 12 Elites.<br> $250</span></center>

    <center><span class="caption"><b>It’s been over a decade since the Air Jordan V was first reissued. In 1999, the first retro runs treated us to several original colorways, including a fresh white and metallic silver combination over Tinker Hatfield’s creation. Remastered today, the subtle colorway we first saw 16 years ago is back.Since his game-winning shot that brought championship glory to North Carolina, Michael Jordan has been at the forefront of basketball consciousness. He took the court in 1985 wearing the original Air Jordan I, simultaneously breaking league rules and his opponents' will while capturing the imagination of fans worldwide.<br>$220</b></span></center>

    <center><span class="caption">The Nike Kobe 9 Elite has done it again. If you had told me two years ago that Eric Avar and Kobe Bryant would create a high-collar Kobe sneaker I would’ve called you crazy. I had a feeling that Kobe would return to a mid-cut shoe, but not an extreme high-cut shoe like the Kobe 9. The Kobe 9 Elite is the whole package. It made playing in a high-top fun and I never would have thought that. It’s just a great shoe to play in and I recommend it for anyone who wants a secure and supportive. Also note that this review is for the Kobe 9 Elite. There is the low-top engineered mesh (EM) version and possibly a Flyknit mid-top model to be released at a later time.<br>$300</span></center>
